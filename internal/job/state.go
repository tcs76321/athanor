// M3-T1 completes §8.2 exactly: the transitions table below now encodes
// the full graph (planning → diverging → evaluating → reflecting →
// synthesizing → comparing → completed/failed) with the §8.2 branch
// logic — evaluating always runs after diverging (§8.2: "no skipping
// evaluation"); reflecting is reached only when no candidate passed
// evaluation, and loops back to diverging within the M3-T4 budget.
// The schema (migration 0004) accepts the full §8.1 state set so the
// edge set could grow without a rebuild. The only edge still absent
// here is `awaiting_approval`, which arrives with HITL in M6.

//
// §8.2 branch rules are encoded in this table, not in the engine:
//
//   - `diverging → evaluating` is mandatory (no skipping evaluation).
//   - `evaluating → synthesizing` is the happy path (≥1 candidate passed).
//   - `evaluating → reflecting` is the failure path (no candidate passed).
//   - `reflecting → diverging` is the budgeted retry loop.
//   - `reflecting → synthesizing` lets reflection produce a final artifact
//     without another divergence pass (e.g. "hybrid of the two best").
//   - `synthesizing → comparing` is mandatory.
//   - Pausing is legal from every active working state; a paused job
//     resumes to the state recorded in paused_from (enforced by the
//     repository, since the table cannot express data-dependent edges).
//   - queued jobs cannot pause — they simply never start.
//
// `awaiting_approval` (M6) is deliberately not an outgoing edge of any
// state: HITL hasn't been wired. Its existence in the §8.1 state set
// satisfies the schema (migration 0004) but no code path can transition
// into or out of it yet.
