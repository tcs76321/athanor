// Package toolenvelope defines the per-job tool allowlist for Job Pod
// tool calls (ARCHITECTURE §25, ROADMAP M2-T4). The set of tools a
// Job Pod may invoke is fixed at job creation time and enforced
// server-side by the internal API before any code runs.
//
// M2-T4 ships a closed set of two tools — execute_code and run_tests —
// because those are the only ones the engine calls today. Additional
// tools from the §25 table (read_file, write_file, git_operation,
// fetch_url, etc.) arrive in M3+ when their consumers land. Adding a
// new tool to the closed set is a project decision, not an agent
// decision: it widens the §25 surface and must be paired with the
// matching internal API route, Gate G2 coverage, and a per-archetype
// policy review.
