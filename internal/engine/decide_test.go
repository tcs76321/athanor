// M3-T2 commit 2.5: table-driven tests for DecideWinner.
//
// DecideWinner is a pure function, so the test is a single
// table with the LLM verdict, the record set, the threshold,
// and the hasPrevious flag as inputs, and the expected final
// winner + the expected downgrade-reason substring as
// outputs. Every row corresponds to a row in ADR-0014 §3.4.
//
// The package doc on decide.go states the §19.3 rule:
//   - LLM says "new", no record meets threshold, no previous → "none"
//   - LLM says "new", no record meets threshold, previous exists → "previous"
//   - LLM says "new", a record meets threshold → "new" (regardless of previous)
//   - LLM says "previous" or "none" → never upgraded by the guard
//   - boundary: confidence == threshold (not strictly greater) → does NOT meet
