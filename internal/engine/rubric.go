// M3-T2 (commit 2.2) per-archetype evaluation rubric (§19.1).
//
// The rubric is the structured checklist the security persona is
// told to apply when scoring a candidate. Each item is a
// phrase the persona may echo into one of the verdict's
// `missing_criteria` / `security_issues` / `style_issues`
// arrays, so the §19.3 deterministic guard can read the
// verdict and act on the same data the persona was told to
// look for.
//
// The rubric is per archetype because the §19.1 checks
// differ: a `text` artifact doesn't need pytest; a `code`
// artifact doesn't need paragraph structure. The closed set
// is the five §6.2 archetypes; `data` and `media` are
// deferred (ROADMAP §7) and return empty, which causes the
// prompt's section-add helper to drop the rubric section
// entirely.
